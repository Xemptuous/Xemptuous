- 👋 Hi, I’m @Xemptuous. I started teaching myself how to code in December of 2021, and am continuing this process for (hopefully) the rest of my life.
- 👀 I’m interested in working on projects to create task automations, as well as eventually learning machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JavaScript, Shell Script, and Lua (although I occasionally do projects in C/C++ to better understand CS).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on larger projects eventually (once I get more experienced).
