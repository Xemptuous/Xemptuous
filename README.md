- 👋 Hi, I’m @Xemptuous. I started teaching myself how to code in December of 2021, and am continuing this process for (hopefully) the rest of my life, and regretting not having done it sooner (due to nonsensical mindset of "its for special types of people"). Currently working as a Developer and scripting automations for a company that has not touched it, and am now innovating their approach (and teaching myself in the process).
- 👀 I’m primarily interested in scripting automations, but also have a keen interest in machine learning, as well as game design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JavaScript, C++, Shell Script, and Lua, but will eventually learn many more (Rust, Go, Typescript, etc.).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on larger projects eventually (once I get more experienced). Hopefully I can make some good contributions to repos as I progress, contributing to the beauty which is open-source.
